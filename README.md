# [Unicamp Open Data Project](http://harvard-open-data-project.github.io/)

## About us

> We're a student-faculty team dedicated to opening and analyzing [Harvard](https://harvard.edu) data to empower our community members to improve campus life.

We've teamed up with the former deputy CTO of the US, Harvard's CTO, and Harvard's Chief Digital Officer to build Harvard's first open data catalog​. We're empowering Harvard students to hack with Harvard data including admissions data, course catalogs, dhall menus, and university finances.​

Our main work includes:

- Gathering open data from around the Harvard community
- Analyzing and visualizing the data, or building applications around it
- Using these results to drive policy changes around Harvard
- Empowering Harvard students to also hack with this data to improve student life or the University

As we expand, we're looking for people with a passion for anything from data science to public policy. Join our team to ​build our web frontend and data analysis tools, create visualizations and apps with Harvard data, work closely with our mentors in the civic tech space, and craft university-wide open data policies.
